You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another start
You fade away

Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?

Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Atlantis

Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream

The monster's running wild
Inside of me
I'm faded

I'm faded

I'm faded

I'm faded

Where are you now?

I'm faded
