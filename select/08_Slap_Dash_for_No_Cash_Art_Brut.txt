Slap dash for no cash
Those are the records I like
Slap dash for no cash
When something doesn't sound quite right

Why isn't everyone trying to sound like U2?
It's not a very cool thing to do
Why would you want to sound like U2?
Just press record and play it straight through
They call it lo-fi, if you say so
Cool your warm jets, Brian Eno

I love the sound of background noise
I wanna hear the crack in the singer's voice
Fingers moving on the fret board
Every time he plays a new chord
I hear his friends hanging around
I hear him play an instrument he just found
I hear a low buzzing sound
I hear his parents hanging around
I hear his parents saying "turn it down"
I hear his parents saying "turn it down"
I hear his parents saying "turn it down!"

Cool your warm jets, Brian Eno
