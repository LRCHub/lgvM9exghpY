In the rental car counting money stacks
All black Benz with the digi dash
It's like a Nascar the way we zoom past
When I was blacking out I won't remember that
When I was blacking out I don't remember shit
But you were dressed in all black
Yeah I remember it
I'm reaching for you but you're not there
It's obvious to me that you don't care
Go on

In the rental car counting money stacks
All black Benz with the digi dash
It's like a Nascar the way we zoom past
When I was blacking out I won't remember that
When I was blacking out I don't remember shit
And I've been too turnt up
So just let me in
From the bottom of the ocean
From the bottom of my heart
'Til death do us part
We can make a brand new start

In the rental car counting money stacks
All black Benz with the digi dash
It's like a Nascar the way we zoom past
When I was blacking out I won't remember that
You won't remember that
No, you won't remember that
That I was with you when you thought you had it figured out

(Our love must not be real to you
Or it must not mean that much to you)

(Our love must not be real to you
Or it must not mean that much to you)

Go on

In the rental car counting money stacks
All black Benz with the digi dash
It's like a Nascar the way we zoom past
When I was blacking out I won't remember that
You won't remember that
No, you won't remember that
